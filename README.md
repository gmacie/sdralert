The biggest take away here is it is based on what you actually hear not on what the world hears and puts on dx servers.

Need to add a config file. Maybe with user's grid so adjacent grids can be ignored.

This is designed for jtsimmer daily output file but I am thinking about creating a version 
that will work on wsjt-x / jtdx so you can leave a rig on a band and get alerts if you are away.
